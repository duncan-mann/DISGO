# DISGO üé∏

Listen, discover, and never miss another show! DISGO is a music streaming platform that utilizes real-world event and music data to integrate seamlessly with the Spotify ecosystem.

Simply enter your location and the dates that you will be there, and DISGO will generate a playlist of all artists playing shows for your search. Filter the results by genre, and export the playlist to your Spotify account for easy listening wherever you go. Finally, view event details and find tickets for your new favourite artists. ü§üüèº

The project was delivered by 3 engineers over a span of 1.5 weeks. The team organized 2-day sprints to tackle various features and held daily agile scrum meetings to set goals, check-in on progress, and brainstorm ideas.
