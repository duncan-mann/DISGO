# DISGO

Listen, discover, and never miss another show! DISGO is a music streaming platform that utilizes real-world event and music data to integrate seamlessly with the Spotify ecosystem.

The project was delivered by 3 engineers over a span of 1.5 weeks. The team organized 2-day sprints to tackle various features and held daily agile scrum meetings to set goals, check-in on progress, and brainstorm ideas.
